Eurovision leaderboard
======================

Modified the Meteor leaderboard example to be a Eurovision song contest leaderboard.

Want to host your own song contest with the same scoring system as used in the Eurovision song contest?
Check out the example at [eurovision.thorsteinsson.is](http://eurovision.thorsteinsson.is).

You can open the website on the monitor in 1080p (1920x1080) and use an iPad (or other tablet) to fill in the scores. Meteor takes care of updating the score on the monitor in real time and showing what song is currently giving points.
